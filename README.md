# MafiaBot - AI-powered organizer of Mafia (Werewolf) matches

## Introduction
This is a school project. A few months prior to starting it, I wanted to build an application that would utilize Discord's new API features (buttons, modals, etc.). This bot allows you and your friends to play a social deduction game of [**Mafia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), also known as Werewolf in the US, without actually having an organizer to manage the game process and assign roles. The bot will join your match's voice channel and narrate in-game actions using Google TTS and OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Almost all in-game messages are generated on the go, with the AI being aware of the game situation. This means that messages will almost never repeat.

## I want to play it! How can I do this?
And here lies the problem with the "AI-powered" part of this project. Because I needed to pay for the use of the bot, it remains just another school project. If you have a strong will to "revive" this project, contact me on Telegram (@thera4ok), and I will provide the database structure to you. Be aware that the database was not properly normalized, and the bot's code itself is of rather poor overall quality.
