# MafiaBot - AI-powered organizer of Mafia (Werewolf) matches

## Introduction
This is a school project. Few month prior to it I wanted to build an application that will utilize Discord's new API features (buttons, modals, etc). This bot allows you and your friends to play a social deduction game of [**Mafia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)), also known as **Werewolf** in the US without actually having an organizer, that will manage the game process and assign roles. The bot will join your match's voice channel and will narrate in-game actions using Google TTS and OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.

Almost all in-game messages are being generated on go with the AI being aware of the game situation. That means, that messages almost never will repeat.

## I want to play it! How can I do this?
And here comes the problem of the "AI-powered" part of this project. Because of the fact, that I needed to actually pay for usage of the bot it remain just another school project. If you have a strong will to "revive" this project, contact me on Telegram (@thera4ok) and I will pass the database structure to you. Beware, that the database was not properly normalised and the bot's code itself has a rather bad overall quality.
